Contract Configurator 0.5.0
- RemoteTech integration!
  - ActiveVesselConnection parameter - indicates that a vessel must have an Omni or dish targetted to the active vessel with the given range.
  - KSCConnectivity parameter - indicates that a vessel must have connectivity back to mission control.
  - SignalDelay parameter - requires a min/max signal delay for a connection.
  - VesselConnectivity parameter - checks for connectivity between two vessels.
  - ActiveVesselRange requirement - requires that a celestial body has a satellite with a minimum active vessel range (achievable via either an omni antenna or dish targetting active vessel).
  - CelestialBodyCoverage requiremnt - requirement for having a dish pointed at the given celestial body.
- Vessel tracking!
  - New define attribute of VesselParameterGroup to associate the ship that completes the parameter to the given name.
